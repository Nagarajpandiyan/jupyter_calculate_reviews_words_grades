              "['Boy did we learn the hard way!! Do your research before booking!! The only redeeming feature of this hotel is the location close to the city. If I could grade this hotel with a \"0.5\" or even a \"0\" I would. This is a 2 star hotel with a popular nightclub on site. Warned about noise after check in. Even found the hotel provided ear plugs - which didn\\'t work !! We were provided with twin beds in a claustrophobic hotbox! One small window which had to be closed at night to minimise the noise from the nightclub. The ensuite was small and had a broken toilet lid and seat. In the room there was outdated information regarding meals. In reality we found - Breakfast available everyday. Lunch only Mon - Friday. No evening meals for guests on weekends. Bar on a Saturday not open until 11.00pm for the nightclub. No room service. No obvious facilities for the disabled.The nightclub proved to be a nightmare for us with the amount of noise generated and also the noise generated by the staff cleaning up and disposing of glass bottles at around 5 am. Hotel does not provide parking and after being directed to a car park ( 5 - 10 minutes walk away from the hotel) that supposedly gave hotel guests a discounted rate we found that we were charged the normal rate. Wifi poor inconsistent unreliable. The staff came across as indifferent and brusque towards hotel guests.In summary grossly overpriced accommodation for the poor accommodation and service it provides, We do NOT recommended this hotel.',\n",
              " 'Got a cheek to call this a hotel, an absolute dump.I was charged €289 for 2 nights in this hovel, how do they get away with this, in my opinion €15 per night would be more suitable. People take my advice go elsewhere, my towel rail in the toilet was a rusty screw on the back of the door and we had lights hanging off the wall above the bed and a TV that went out of style in the 1980,s, what a dump and in my opinion a death trap if a fire was to break out',\n",
              " 'Worst hotel I have stayed in. There\\'s no AC, holes in the door, holes in bathtub, dirty carpeting and a nightclub in the basement that goes till 4 am. Someone should buy this hotel and make it fabulous. It probably has really good \"bones\" and could be redone as a boutique hotel. The staff on the other hand was VERY KIND when we told them we had to leave due to the noise and the lack of air. Wouldn\\'t recommend this to anyone.',\n",
              " \"Stayed one night, at a hugely overpriced rate, got back to hotel at about 12 midnight. Got to sleep at about 5:30am. Made complaint at about 3am to night manager (Mark, who was very nice it must be said) about the noise, as was told by the receptionist that it would continue until probably 4:30. I was aware of the nightclub when I made the booking, and was prepared to be awake till around 3, but 5:30 is ridiculous. Nowhere on the website does it specify when nightclubs close or when the noise is likely to settle down.Our room faced onto the street, and the windows are not double glazed. The noise from the street, coupled with the noise from the nightclub, was deafening. On checkout I refused to pay the full fee, and without even coming to meet me and apologise, the manager on duty told the receptionist to give me a discount. Now, while I appreciated the gesture, the reduction only brought the charge down to the 'normal' nightly rate, which in my opinion is still overpriced. This is a perfect hotel for those who plan to be out all night, and only get a little bit of sleep. Not for anyone who is going to bed 'early'.\",\n",
              " \"This hotel cost us 170 euros per night. I would rather sleep on the street. I don't know where to start- staff friendly enough, but they would have to be at rates like this. The rest is dreadful .Our room was 6 foot above a very loud noisy night club, youths congregated right below our room shouting, smoking swearing, and very loud music. I had one hours sleep. That's all. the room was hot, so you had to open the window to cool down. This let bugs into the room, where I was bitten all over.The hotel furniture is basically hand made rubbish gloss painted.The TV? It must be 30 years old, 6 inches square and 8 foot off the ground, with no remote, so basically, only one channel.Unless you are young, and a very expensive place to rest your head- go to the more famous hotels, there are plenty off them.\",\n",
              " \"Stayed for 2 nights and as per previous review writer, I would probably rather sleep on the street if given the choice of returning! The staff were friendly enough. However, the rooms were the most run down that I have ever seen. In my employment I have seen very poor homeless accommodation that is like the ritz compared to the river house. The street noise was unbelievable, even with the windows shut. Avoid here if you are a remotely light sleeper. The location is handy for central Dublin but have your wallet ready to be ripped off throughout Dublin. The shower was powerful but the bathroom was very outdated and tiles were loose on the floor and roof. The hotel recommended a parking block and with the hotel stamp we got a couple of euros off the parking bill. Beware - do not park on this street outside this hotel as you are sure to be clamped, we seen this frequently during our two day stay. I didn't expect to stay at a top notch hotel but this 'hotel' is grim. All visitors to the hotels looked disgruntled and miffed!\",\n",

Up a narrow staircase we found our room. Brown musty loose fitting carpet flowed from the downstairs right up into our room. The beds were at an L shape. Never seen before!! A door mat was set in front of one bed obviously to wipe your feet when getting out of bed. Sitting on the creaky bed I looked up to see that upstairs had leaked a lot of water that had run down the walls and dried in. Black spot everywhere. The window rattled all night and when we woke up the next morning the sun shone through the moth holes in the curtains. 200 euro and not even a breakfast. Really disgraceful. How do these people get away with calling that place a hotel. A dog hotel would be more apt. Shameful and quite insulting that the owner would assume people would gladly stay and pay for the exceptionally poor excuse of accommodation.',\n",

The reality was a dirty hole damp walls black spot all over curtains dirty brown carpet with car mats strategically covering stains badly broken glass in front window that permanently rattled noise from street all night the beds ....I've never seen a bed arrangement like it....... I could go on but couldn't give the place any more airtime ... I would say that if you had a big smelly dog and needed to stay in an inn this would be the one as it has the ambiance of a dog kennel\",\n",
              " \"Don't be fooled by the photographs posted of the new refurbished room because like everyone else you will be told that they are not available and will not be available for the duration for your stay. The hotel is very run down however it's really only suitable for young people who don't mind the noise from the nightclub below and don't have very high standards. The blonde receptionist was very rude, but the male night porter/receptionist was very welcoming.\",\n",
              " \"Where to begin! In summary, in 17 years as a field engineer I have stayed in many hotels. This, without a doubt, was the worst experience I have ever had!I arrived on the Monday morning having caught an early flight across to Dublin. Our trusty Team Secretary had booked a room for me here (at the time of booking it was known as 'The Camden Hotel by Thekeycollection'. Arrived early but unable to book in, so dropped my luggage off and went to work. I arrived back at the hotel at 1340hrs hoping to check in and expecting a rest after my early start. The room wasn't available (apparently it needed a 'deep clean'....not a good sign), and I eventually managed to get in at around 1420hrs.No chance of a rest due to the building works going on, so I gave up on any prospect of relaxing until the evening. Some chance! My room directly overlooked the bar area, with a single glazed (obscured) window. The music went on until 2330hrs. Ah well, at least I could lie in in the morning. Nope! Workmen started at 0715hrs! Went off to work and then had a repeat of the previous night, music until 2330hrs.Wednesday night had the added drama that when the music finished at 2330hrs I was able to grab some sleep......until 0230hrs when some noisy guests moved in across the corridor. My polite request for them to keep the noise down was met with a threatening response, and after a few calls to the concierge they were removed from the room at 5am (and they had been smoking in the room too....I hope they got billed the advertised 200 Euros!).At one point I went into the bathroom to see silverfish darting across the bathtub! Not a good sign!The Thursday night saw the music playing until 3am, and when I opened the window and looked out into the club/bar....IT WAS EMPTY!!! What the hell! I even tried to sleep in the bathroom (with the silverfish) but the music was still too loud. The hotel provide complementary earplugs (not a good sign), but I can't, nor should I have to, sleep with these in. I spoke to the concierge several times on the Thursday night to express my dissatisfaction, but it did no use. The music would drop in volume a little, and then creep back up. And every morning, by 0730hrs, I was woken from my brief slumber by the power tools and hammering below.In all, a stressful, sleepless week. The result of which is that our company will not be booking staff in there in future.The furniture was laughably shabby, the bedding starchy, the rooms stuffy (no aircon, and I couldn't open the window due to the noise)...it reminded me of Elwood Blues' room!And those silverfish!!!\",\n",
              " \"First off, I booked this hotel on the recommendation of a tour guide, on the basis it ticked all the boxes for a stag party, the lads are nothing to raucous or salacious but certainly enjoy ourselves and love music. The hotel in itself is clean and basic, its also prepared for noise as each bed comes with earplugs but I cant fault it there, it fit the requirements.But my goodness the booking was a nightmare, I had a deposit paid two months before our stay only to be hung up on, when attempting to pay the rest of the bill in advance. Finally on sorting this out by having to go into the hotel a week prior to check in (thankfully I work close by) . On check in when the other 8 lads arrived again they were asked for more money. I went to the reception and informed them that it had been paid in full using my credit card, this was accepted, but I was told they would have to look into it yet again, leaving everything in the balance until checkout. I have never stayed in such an unprofessional place that continually asks guests for money, I realize they said it was a mistake, fine but there was no recompense or real apology for this pretty large( approx. 1500eur) mistake but I doesn't help the fact that they had my credit card details, I couldn't relax here TBH. Even If I were to be organizing another Stag in Dublin, Id avoid this place.\",\n",
              " \"This hotel is extremely dated and dirty! There are broken tiles on our bathroom floor and mold in our shower. The hotel does not have in room a/c so it's loud with the windows open and all I hear are seagulls, drunk people and traffic!\",\n",
              " 'All the advertising for this hotel mentions that it has its own bar -it does not. Turns out the bar was closed some months ago. Another misleading statement is \"free wifi\" -the wifi here is so weak it is unusable even for checking emails, let alone anything more demanding. We chose this hotel partly because it is close to the centre of Dublin. This is absolutely the only positive point I can make for it (however, it is not a nice area) -in retrospect, we should have stayed somewhere nicer and used the bus! The prices seem cheap, but you still get bad value for money as this place is little more than a hostel.The room was tiny, with broken furnishings, burns all over the patched up carpet, horrible bed -really uncomfortable. The bathroom was shabby and cramped. Water in the shower constantly fluctuated in temperature making it hard work. Very noisy, no double glazing and, it would seem, paper thin walls. Constant creaking of floorboards, noise from TVs, talking etc.The hotel feels un-secure. They have a terrible system where they ask you to leave your key at reception whenever you leave the hotel, but when you pick up a key no-one checks who you are (and the reception staff were different every day). Seems too easy for someone to just walk in and just get any key! We took our valuables out with us at all times, despite the inconvenience.Another dubious thing is that there is no drinkable water from the taps (unsafe due to lead pipes we were told) so if you want to use the kettle in the room you have to go out and buy bottled water for it!I am a low-maintenance traveler and was expecting something cheap and basic from this hotel, and that would have been fine, but the place is just awful.',\n",

The hotel offered a 10% off promo on their website, which they then did not honor. When I explained my booking experience, and showed the 10% discount to the hotel staff member at reception he said the discount had already been included, but he wasn't able to tell me the full price before discount. It was a complete scam, he was incredibly unprofessional, don't stay here! The area is also not that great, getter off finding a hotel south of the river.\",\n",

The room had lights that were broken, some hanging out of the ceiling, one of the night tables had a handle pulled off so they simply drilling another hole to the right and put another in, the shower was built for people 4 ft. tall, and the floor of the bathtub was so slippery that my 25 year old niece fell and thought she broke her leg.

When my husband went down to reception to ask for one. It was such a big deal to get one for us. We had a room to the back of the hotel and it was so loud from all the people outside and also music!!!! And also the smell from cigarette smoke from the outside of the pup was unreal!!!!!

Name was Emilio who was comparably less accommodating than the first lady. He was very rude and made us feel like we were school children being told off rather than enduring good customer service. We asked for adjacent rooms and he said IF its available and not that he'll try. He was very dismissive and had a very bad attitude. Inside the hotel, it was clean and the rooms were clean but the shower cream was empty but luckily there was a supermarket where we were able to buy some toiletries as the toilet provided none but tissue paper. Hence the price we paid for it. The room was too hot and the window only opened a few inches. There was no other ventilation or air conditioning so had no choice but to sleep in a very warm room. We had breakfast at the hotel and considering we had it at 8am and it was not very busy, it was a big let down that they had ran out of orange juice but we had no other drink but milk. The area was a bit rough and because it was a warm room, we had to have the windows open. We had to listen to 2 drunken men outside shouting at each other. Also witnessed one of them urinating at the bus stop. Not a pleasant sight.

Once we had sat down it took a while for us to be acknowledged and the service was slow for the whole evening- we only ever saw 1 waiter. Would be a lot better if they had more staff. They sat us in a dark corner upstairs.Water was provided at the table, However he asked us if we wanted to order drinks then before we answered ran off and didn't return for 30 minutes so we had to go downstairs and order wine at the bar.The food was hit and miss, the starters were all delicious. However the burger I had was over cooked and served cold. The music was extremely loud and difficult to talk as a group as couldn't hear people across the table. Drinks were extremely expensive.There were only 2 toilets for the ladies (not enough for a venue of this size) so gave up queuing to go at one point must have been waiting 15 minutes. Also one toilet had no toilet roll. This is more of a bar than a restaurant, even then drinks are very overpriced probably due to it also being a hotel & mostly tourists visiting. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel for a meal for a hen party.\",\n",

I went back down for them to reactivate it and climbed back up the stairs. This happened three times before I could get in to the room!It looked pleasant enough upon entering, but there was a lot of noise from the busy road out front, so I went to shut the window. Only, it wasn't open. That's genuinely just the noise you have to put up with through the paper thin window! Hopefully you are not a light sleeper like I am.Unfortunately from there it all went down hill. My bedside lamp didn't work, the socket by the bed had something snapped inside, there was something under the radiator which I hoped was just an old malteser that had been missed when the room was supposedly cleaned. The bathroom was also very tired looking, the soap tray under the shower was only just hanging on to the wall.On the plus side, the bed was comfortable and linen and towels were clean. The bar downstairs has a superb interior and great ambience.Given, it's a great location, but at the end of the day I expect a good night's sleep from any hotel, the other mishaps only added to my annoyance from lack of sleep and given the price of these rooms I'm not even the slightest bit tempted to review at more than 1 star.\",\n",

Thanks for taking the time to flag this with us. We do have big issues with noise on Harcourt Street. We have some rooms that are quiet-er but nothing we'd consider silent by a long stretch. Harcourt street is the singlemost busiest area in Dublin/Ireland for nightlife in general, we're completely surrounded by night clubs/late venues. Although there is little we can do to control this, we try to assign the quiet-est rooms to corporate guests, longer stays, pre-requests etc. to minimize the impact on our guests. I'm sorry if this wasn't communicated on arrival, I will follow up internally to prevent the next guest from being in the same position.  As recently as this week we have undertaken additional construction work/acoustic insulation at our expense to isolate us from our neighbours. We're working hard behind the scenes as a management to lessen the impact of noise on our guests comfort.  In relation to the lights, coffee machine and basin - we greatly appreciate feedback and I have personally followed up with our housekeeping and maintenance teams to ensure it does not happen for another guest.

              " 'My mother and I stayed at your hotel last week and overall it was a dreadful experience.Firstly, it was described on Booking.com as a “quiet haven”. It is not. For a hotel surrounded by car rental depots and other commercial and industrial premises, it is totally misleading to describe it as a quiet haven.When we arrived tired and hungry at 9:30pm, later than planned due to travel delays, we were told the restaurant was closing, even though we had called earlier to check we could still get food until 10pm. The receptionist (who greeted us in a rather cold and fed-up manner) called the wait staff and ordered them to keep the kitchen open, so we rushed through to the restaurant. The waiter to be fair was sweet and smiley, but he did start the conversation by saying ...”oh the chef is gonna be pissed off, grab a table and order quickly!”. The food was not good. We had booked a twin room that, according to the photos on Booking.com had two small double beds. On arrival we were told by the receptionist that we had been upgraded to a suite. However, the “suite” was a room on the ground floor, at the front of the hotel, next to the busy car park. It was a room with one small double bed a tiny single bed. It was noisy and depressing. My mother was really quite upset as this was not at all what she expected when booking. I went back to reception to query the room, and before I had even finished my sentence I was interrupted by another grumpy male receptionist to be told they were fully booked. This was not an answer to the question I was trying to ask, but it did make it a little clearer as to why we had been “upgraded”. I have worked in the hotel industry as an assistant manager and I know how these things work, so it was not a kind gesture but actually a shuffle of rooms to accommodate all the guests. In short, the two receptionists were very unhelpful, cold, and dismissive. We went to bed feeling really deflated.The next day we tried to look on the bright side, we had a nice day out in Dublin but had already decided that this was not the hotel we had thought we’d booked, and certainly not the quiet haven we expected. As a consequence, on Thursday morning (we arrived Tuesday night), we changed our flights to fly home 2 days early. The hotel gave us a receipt for all 4 nights even though we had only stayed two. They said that this was because we had paid up front through Booking.com. They tried to charge us for all 4 breakfasts (we had only had two), until we asked them to please refund us the £40. The staff in short were awful, and since returning home we have tried to get a little compensation for the 2 nights we were not there for, but no response. I highly advise steering clear of this so called Hotel.',\n",

I had booked the hotel through hotelsireland.com with a voucher I had received. I had all the confirmation letters printed out and in order but when we went to check in the receptionist straight out refused to accept the confirmation booking and stated that they didn't accept the voucher, even though I had the paperwork. She stated that I didn't book through the voucher website and that they couldn't accept it as part of the payment. She then implied that the fault was on my part and that I had to sort it out with hotelsireland.com as she had other customers to deal with, which I found quite rude. To check into the room we had to give the full amount deposit on my Visa card - which took 7 days before I could access that money again. The whole ordeal took over 30 minutes. I rang hotelsireland and they were so helpful - I gave them my reference number and they checked it out saying everything was in order and that the booking was sent to the Hampton the day after I had booked. The lady then rang the Hampton herself and sorted the whole thing out in a matter of minutes. On checking out I paid the remaining balance - which I was expecting to do in the first place but was still €150 out of pocket for 7 days because of the deposit payment I had to pay unnecessarily.

The bellman took me to my room and it appeared that the carpet hadn\\'t been cleaned in years. The room was dingy and in need of a good updating. After returning to my room for dinner and drinks, there was a raging party going on down the hall. No big deal I thought, it will die down eventually. At 1:00 AM it was still going. I informed the front desk and they told me \"there was nothing that they could do\". Apparently, a group had reserved that part of the hotel for a party. I asked to change rooms and was told that since I\\'d already been checked into this room for 9 hours, it wasn\\'t possible. I was offered a tiny discount on the room instead. I don\\'t want a discount, I want a quiet night of sleep!! To be clear, the issue was not the street noise which is a modest hum given the hotel\\'s proximity to the bars in the area. That would have been tolerable. The next morning when I checked out, I made mention of the issues. They gave me the Managers card and told me to email him. So, I did, and after four days, I received a snarky response from the manager telling me that it was well documented on the website that it\\'s a noisy hotel??? In addition, he mentioned that I\\'d likely never be back anyway since I was from out of the country so there was nothing that he was willing to do. He also mentioned that I was the only complaint of that night which is a bold faced lie as when I was at the desk complaining about the noise, so was another guest. To make matters worse, I asked for the hotel to arrange a car for me. When I checked out, I inquired whether or not the car would accept a credit card. I was assured that it would.

              " 'I stayed 5 nights in May 2017 at the Waterloo House. The house is quaint, my room had a nice view and breakfast was delicious, but my experience was tainted by electrical issues. In a nutshell: plugging my laptop adapter in a power outlet at this house KILLED THE ADAPTER. Here’s how it happened: When I first arrived in my room, I noticed one of the lamps would not turn on. I notified the clerk at the desk that the lightbulb was burnt, but she said that this outlet did not work, adding that the electrician could not figure out why. Fine, I thought, I’ll use other outlets and lamps… I should have been more suspicious of the state of the electrical wiring, because as soon as I plugged in my laptop to charge it – in another outlet of course – the power went out in the room and my charger had a burnt smell! I notified the clerk again, and while she was very nice, she did not seem particularly surprised, and suggested I talk to Evelyn (Corcoran), the owner. Evelyn nicely told me that this “hardly ever happens”… indeed, she said THIS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE, but to other devices (!). I understand this is an old house (that’s part of its charm), but a faulty electrical system is not what I expected. Being in Dublin for work, I needed to be able to charge my laptop, so I went to a computer store. The employee said the “frying” of my adapter was likely due to a power surge. I had to buy a new adapter there, then one back home: I am Canadian, and the computer store in Dublin (of course) did not have adapters with North American plugs. This cost me 53€ (about 80CDN$) for the adapter bought in Dublin, plus about 31€ (48CDN$) for the one bought at home, for a total of about 84€. Not a fortune, not as bad as if I had found bedbugs in my room of course, but still frustrating!Evelyn has not offered (or accepted) to cover these expenses, she says this is likely due to a faulty charger, despite the fact that my laptop is of a renowned brand, the charger is 100-240V and I used it many times in Europe (using appropriate outlet adapters of course), in the UK, France, Spain, Greece, Norway and elsewhere in Dublin, for instance at University College Dublin where was the academic conference I was attending. I travel a lot for work and pleasure and this had never happened to me. I must say, it somewhat ruined what could have been a very pleasant stay at the Waterloo House, and I feel that other travelers should be aware of this risk, and the potential danger that comes with staying in a house with electrical issues, before booking . Evelyn wrote me that she “could not run a business with an electrical fault as it would be very dangerous”… I agree about the danger part. BOOK AT YOUR OWN RISK!',\n",

I was aware of the nightclub when I made the booking, and was prepared to be awake till around 3, but 5:30 is ridiculous. Nowhere on the website does it specify when nightclubs close or when the noise is likely to settle down.Our room faced onto the street, and the windows are not double glazed. The noise from the street, coupled with the noise from the nightclub, was deafening. On checkout I refused to pay the full fee, and without even coming to meet me and apologise, the manager on duty told the receptionist to give me a discount. Now, while I appreciated the gesture, the reduction only brought the charge down to the 'normal' nightly rate, which in my opinion is still overpriced. This is a perfect hotel for those who plan to be out all night, and only get a little bit of sleep. Not for anyone who is going to bed 'early'.\",\n",

Harcourt street is the singlemost busiest area in Dublin/Ireland for nightlife in general, we're completely surrounded by night clubs/late venues.

As recently as this week we have undertaken additional construction work/acoustic insulation at our expense to isolate us from our neighbours.

Firstly when I arrived, I was told that I had only booked a double room. I explained that I had double checked my email and it says triple room and I paid more, to which the receptionist pointed to his form and said no it was a double. Clearly this was not my fault or the receptionists fault but his response was pointless. There is obviously an issue between the booking site and the hotel details. He did find me a room with a double and single bed and I was grateful as we were all very exhausted from an active day.When I got to the room and ready for bed, we discovered a problem with the electrics, only one plug in the room worked. As it was late I decided to get some sleep and report in the morning.I reported the problem to the receptionist on the morning and he advised he would get someone to look at it.We arrived back to the hotel late that evening and I asked the reception staff if he was aware if the plugs had been fixed in my room. He didn't know anything about it and I hoped this was a good sign. Unfortunately when we got to the room there was no change. Again as it was late we just wanted to get to sleep.I reported the problem to the receptionist in the morning and when she checked the system she said the fault had been noted but there were no maintenance staff available on a Sunday to fix it. I had made the most of a frustrating situation and moved furniture to be able to use the hairdryer in the room and asked reception staff to charge phones. while I accept these difficulties can arise I feel the staff in this situation need to learn how to effectively communicate. I should have been told there were no maintenance staff, I could have been offered an alternative room and I should have had a phone call or message left for me on my return. In addition the standard of finish and cleanliness of this room was poor, it was very dated and grubby.

For a hotel surrounded by car rental depots and other commercial and industrial premises, it is totally misleading to describe it as a quiet haven.When we arrived tired and hungry at 9:30pm, later than planned due to travel delays, we were told the restaurant was closing, even though we had called earlier to check we could still get food until 10pm. The receptionist (who greeted us in a rather cold and fed-up manner) called the wait staff and ordered them to keep the kitchen open, so we rushed through to the restaurant. The waiter to be fair was sweet and smiley, but he did start the conversation by saying ...”oh the chef is gonna be pissed off, grab a table and order quickly!”. The food was not good. We had booked a twin room that, according to the photos on Booking.com had two small double beds. On arrival we were told by the receptionist that we had been upgraded to a suite. However, the “suite” was a room on the ground floor, at the front of the hotel, next to the busy car park. It was a room with one small double bed a tiny single bed. It was noisy and depressing. My mother was really quite upset as this was not at all what she expected when booking. I went back to reception to query the room, and before I had even finished my sentence I was interrupted by another grumpy male receptionist to be told they were fully booked. This was not an answer to the question I was trying to ask, but it did make it a little clearer as to why we had been “upgraded”. I have worked in the hotel industry as an assistant manager and I know how these things work, so it was not a kind gesture but actually a shuffle of rooms to accommodate all the guests. In short, the two receptionists were very unhelpful, cold, and dismissive. We went to bed feeling really deflated.The next day we tried to look on the bright side, we had a nice day out in Dublin but had already decided that this was not the hotel we had thought we’d booked, and certainly not the quiet haven we expected. As a consequence, on Thursday morning (we arrived Tuesday night), we changed our flights to fly home 2 days early. The hotel gave us a receipt for all 4 nights even though we had only stayed two. They said that this was because we had paid up front through Booking.com. They tried to charge us for all 4 breakfasts (we had only had two), until we asked them to please refund us the £40. The staff in short were awful, and since returning home we have tried to get a little compensation for the 2 nights we were not there for, but no response.

The bathrooms floors were sticky and spotted, the shower curtain liners were black with mildew, one room had a horrible and persistent smell, one sink did not drain at all, the vents were covered in dust, there were random smears of Gd knows what on the shower walls, one room's windows did not open at all and there was no AC or ventilation. Gross and loud, as our rooms overlooked a beer garden next door. The lobby was likewise nasty, with a sticky counter and floors. I am not sure how other guests gave good reviews, this hotel was totally sub-par, especially for the price.\",\n",

She asked for €500 deposit plus my credit card. Now management is denying responsibility and defended itself by saying I should have read the fine print in my bill. Sucks !!!!',\n",
              " 'what a bad hotel!! i don’t know where to begin. the rooms are smaller than small. there is no room to put your clothes, lights are not working, it is loud 24h,so if you would like to sleep just for an hour, no way. the windows do not block the noise at all. there is no air in the rooms after 2 hours with 2 people in the room you will snap for air. at night, when we wanted to go to sleep, we had to find out that both beds in our room had big stains on the matrass cover it looked like blood on. it was disgusting!!! like all of the hotel! the manager, naomi, is very rude and plays the hard business woman. not very nice when you pay over 200e for one night, for a room which would be ok for e70. very, very bad experience. never ever again not even if they would pay my to stay there. the only good thing about the hotel, they gave us a discount of 75% for the one night for the bloody sheets. we left after one night and found us a very nice place for the same price. horrible hotel in a wonderful city.',\n",
              " \"One star for the location. Thats it. Small very hot room with windows that open only a crack. Stifling air quality. Actually you can smell some kind of fume when you walk in the room. 2 fans going and i can barely breath. Very stuffy. I had to remove the synthetic comforter and sleep only with the cover was so frigging hot. Tossed and turn all night. Barely slept. Whats worse there is some sort of bottle recycling plant crunching bottles so you have to close the windows to get some sleep. Not much air coming thru the crack anyway. Absurd!!! The fridge is even warm. It smells like something died in there. Not kidding.You could do so much better then this place for less money. I stayed at a hotel on Abbey street right across the hapenny bridge, twice the size and half the price with windows that opened!!! Reception has air conditioning. Its almost a cruel sick joke.I'm checking into an Airbnb tomorrow. Can't wait to gtfoh!!\",\n",
              " \"My travel tour agency recommended this place. I have since told them to stop. I am on my second and final stay of 2 nights. Room came with air conditioning but it was broken. Mentioned it 3 times and was assured it would be checked out. I still have no air conditioning. I have sleep apnea and cooler air makes my breathing easier. I did request a fan and after second request it finally showed up. Could not sleep with windows open as I was next to fire house and road noise. The first nights dinner took 2 hours to show up and my wife's lamb was cold. My sons fries were old and stale. Not acceptable. One positive is the morning breakfast buffet. It has a great selection of foods. They even offer gluten free bread. I found staff to be dismissive with discussions about food and rooms. I have a large family and will tell them not to stay here on their next visit to Ireland. I am unsure if problems stem from management or owners who do not care about maintenance and upkeep. Avoid it like the plague\",\n",
              " 'The fire alarm went off repeatedly early in the morning but the hotel made no attempt to let people know these were false alarms. This is absolutely unacceptable.

Quick points *There was no AC * The taps didn't work *The shower leaded and was wrapped up with tape *Its noisey *The view from the windows in our room was laughable, lovely roof covered in AC units that don't work! *Bathroom covered in mould *Stained sheets - I could go on!Do not be fooled into thinking the location will make up for negatives of this hotel, there are other hotels - book those instead! That's the hotel, the dinner & show... The table layabouts was rubbish, the food was in-edible, IT WAS INSANELY HOT! The service was terrible! It was so loud, you could speak to someone next to you.

However, we just spent the night in room 788 and never slept a wink. A domestic argument in room 786 until the wee small hours put paid to that. My partner was going to phone police. It was that bad. Paper thin walls didn't help and we heard everything. There was wall punching, door slamming, roaring, shouting, swearing, what appeared to be slapping and lots of crying. It was nothing short of a disgrace. The management had already said the hotel was fully booked so no point I asking to change rooms. It was 5am before we got any sleep and only then, because the female left. I accept that this is no fault of the hotels but I paid for a bed to sleep and couldn't. It wasn't cheap either. I reported to the girl on check out who seemed wholly disinterested. Always liked the hotel but doubt , I'll stay again. Going home completely wrecked after what was to be a comfortable hotel stay\",\n",
              " 'My sister in law contacted the hotel on Tuesday 18th July to inform the hotel that she would no longer be able to attend due to unforeseen circumstances. She was advised that she would not be able to amend the date or be issued with a refund. As she was under the impression that the booking had been fully paid for she offered me the room as she did not want to let the reservation go to waste. I knew I would be travelling late and called the hotel to query the latest check in time and when the residents bar closed. I was advised that 12 pm was the latest check in time and 11 pm was the closing time for the residents bar. This was misinformation as my husband rang straight after and was advised that you could check in at any time and the residents bar in fact closed at a much later time. We explained the situation over the phone and was told to come on ahead. When we arrived we experienced the most unpleasant check in I have ever experienced. We were met by an extremely rude member of staff, who really should not be dealing with the public in his mannor. Judging by his dress code and age I would assume quite a senior member of staff. As the first point of contact to the hotel please retrain this man in customer service. When my husband was trying to explain the situation he kept rudely interrupting saying ‘you do not understand sir’ and at one point during this conversation my husband was trying to resolve the situation by simply stating the booking reference number and he assumbed this was a six digit pin and he said he did not want to see information of this type aand my husband also explained that we had came here on the understanding that the room had been paid for fully. In response, the staff member seemed to become quite irritated with us so my husband went to the car to get his phone to phone the person who had made the booking. This person was willing to confirm her card details over the phone and pay for the room as she thought the room had already been paid for anyway as if we had not turned up to take the room the money would have been taken off the very same card infact. We were cautious about paying for the room when asked in case this meant that the room had been paid for twice. The member of staff refused to speak to the person who had made the booking over the phone and stated that he needed the card to be physically in my husbands hand there and then in order for the payment to be taken. Due to the treatment we received from this staff member if it hadn’t have been so late at night we would have turned around and went home. The staff member showed us a complete lack of respect and we were left feeling disappointed. Very poor customer service for a hotel of this star rating. At check-in time we were not informed of breakfast serving times or locations. We assumed that are door would be knocked 10 minutes prior to breakfast serving time as this is the procedure used in many hotel that we have stayed in over the years. At this point my husband mad the full payment for the room in order to avoid further embarrassment. It is key to note although we were in the position we were able to pay for this reservation at such short notice many couples may not have been able to. Next we were issued with our hotel room key and handed over to another staff member who brought us to the car park and brought us to our room . This staff member was extremely helpful and courteous. After leaving our luggage in our room we headed down to the main bar area for a few relaxing drinks after the whole ordeal. We were served our drinks by a Barman by an extremely friendly bar man but unfortunately the pints that he pulled had absolutely no head on them and were flat. I could clearly see this man had not received proper training in how to pull a pint correctly .My husband had to change his drink over to wine as a result of the standard of the pint served , and my husband would not usually enjoy this as his main drink in the bar. When we arrived up to our room afterwards we noticed our room was very clean although the décor was quite outdated and the bathroom looked like it was from the 1960s. To conclude the are much better hotels based in the Dublin area with better locations, service as well as value for money. I would not advise anyone to use their hard-earned money staying here if you wish to feel valued. The old beauty and charm of the hotel has gone , that my mother and father talked about as they stayed here for years. I would have hoped the standards would have raised instead of dropped.',\n",

Couldn't use the shower as it was broken. Honestly worst hotel room I have ever been in. Can't say anything about staff as we just went out as soon as possible. Oh and €25 for parking a day.

When we arrived at the room it was quite small, the only thing to suggest it is a suite was a larger bathroom, otherwise the room was dark, really hot and stuffy. We put the air con on when we left the room and when we came back it was warm. Sleeping was unbearable and we couldn't contact any of the hotel services. In fact when we came back all we could see was security at the front lobby and nobody at reception.When we asked to speak to a manager the next morning he apologised about the air con and was aware they had a problem with it in the hotel. No gestures were offered and guess what...€450 does not include breakfast, it is disappointing to see these hotels totally rob people when an 'event' is on.I will never be back here again, the Shelbourne is the place to stay!!\",\n",

Even found the hotel provided ear plugs - which didn\\'t work !! We were provided with twin beds in a claustrophobic hotbox! One small window which had to be closed at night to minimise the noise from the nightclub. The ensuite was small and had a broken toilet lid and seat. In the room there was outdated information regarding meals. In reality we found - Breakfast available everyday. Lunch only Mon - Friday. No evening meals for guests on weekends. Bar on a Saturday not open until 11.00pm for the nightclub. No room service. No obvious facilities for the disabled.The nightclub proved to be a nightmare for us with the amount of noise generated and also the noise generated by the staff cleaning up and disposing of glass bottles at around 5 am. Hotel does not provide parking and after being directed to a car park ( 5 - 10 minutes walk away from the hotel) that supposedly gave hotel guests a discounted rate we found that we were charged the normal rate. Wifi poor inconsistent unreliable. The staff came across as indifferent and brusque towards hotel guests.In summary grossly overpriced accommodation for the poor accommodation and service it provides, We do NOT recommended this hotel.'"
